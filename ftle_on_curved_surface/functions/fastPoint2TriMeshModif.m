    %% Main function to Determine nearest points between an arbitrary point and triangulated surface
    % This code takes in a triangulated surface of faces and nodes/vertices
    % such as those present in STLs. It then takes a set of arbitrary
    % points in space and determines the nearest point on the triangulated
    % surface to this point, as well as the distance away. This code is
    % similar to an existing algoirthm by Daniel Frisch called
    % "point2TriMesh", but is written more efficiently and provides
    % significant speed increases.
    
    % For example, to determine the projection
    % of 10,000 points to the included example surface, the time in
    % Point2TriMesh is approximately 100 seconds. Using this implementation
    % the exact same points can be obtained in approximately 0.3 seconds
    % without parallel computing and 0.18 seconds with parallel computing.
    % Additionally, the proposed algorithm allows values to be stored
    % allowing for subsequent computations to take less time.
    
    % The algorithm works by either taking in or calculating the circle
    % incenter of every triangle, as well as the normal direction to each
    % face or calculating it. Additionally, it either takes in or
    % calculates an initial KDTree for the original face incenters. The
    % code then determines the nearest average face to every one of the
    % inputted test/query points using a KNN Search and the previously
    % created KDTree. These points are used to determine the initial
    % distance and projection. The code then checks every projection point,
    % and first ensures that it is inside the given triangle. If the
    % calcualted projection point is outside of the triangle, the code
    % determines the minimum distance to each of the face's 3 edges to the
    % arbitrary point and then uses the minimum distance and correpsonding
    % point as the projection. This is repeated for every point to get the
    % distance, and projection point for every query point. The face
    % normals are used to determine a positive or negative sign depending
    % on whether the point is nearest the positive normal direction
    % (outside) or the negative normal direction (inside)
    
    % INPUTS:
    % inputs.faces = (N x 3) the faces of the original triangulated surface (Required)
    % inputs.nodes = (M x 3) the nodes or vertices of the original triangulated surface (Required)
    % inputs.face_mean_nodes = (N x 3) the location of the incenter of each
    %                     triangle. This can either be calculated using "getTriInCenter.m" ahead
    %                     of time, or calculated herein.
    % inputs.face_normals = (N x 3) the unit normal direction to each face.
    %                     This can either be calculated using "getFaceCenterAndNormals.m" ahead
    %                     of time, or calculated herein.
    % inputs.tree_model = (model) the KDTree trained to each triangle
    %                     incenter using "KDTreeSearcher.m" This can either be calculated using "KDTreeSearcher.m"
    %                     ahead of time, or calculated herein.
    % pts = (Q x 3) Arbitrary points that we are trying to project onto the
    %                     surface (Required)
    % use_parallel = (0 or 1) A binary that determines whether to use (1) the parallel computing
    %                      or not use (0) the parallel computing. NOTE this requires the parallel computing toolbox(Required)
    
    % OUTPUTS:
    % distances= (Q x 1) The signed distance for each arbitary point (pts)
    %                     to the nearest point on the triangulated surface. Positive means the
    %                     point is off of the positive face normal, where as negative means the
    %                     point is nearest the opposite direction to the
    %                     face normal.
    % project_pts= (Q x 3) The location of the projected point for each arbitary point (pts)
    %                     to the nearest point on the triangulated surface.
    % outside= (Q x 1) A boolean array representing if the given point is on the positive direction
    %                     (1) or the negative direction (0) of the corresponding surface
